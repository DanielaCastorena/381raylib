Sure, here's the revised README without "RaySnake":

## Simple P2P: Snake

Snake is a simple game implemented in C++ using the Raylib library. This README provides an overview of the game and instructions for playing.

### Overview

Snake is a classic game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes apples. The goal is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the game window's borders.

### Gameplay

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
- The snake moves continuously in the direction it's facing.
- The snake can pass through the borders of the game window and will reappear on the opposite side.
- The snake grows longer each time it consumes an apple.
- The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the game window's borders.
- After the game ends, press Enter to restart.

### Dependencies

Snake requires the Raylib library to run. Make sure you have Raylib installed on your system before running the game.

### Controls

- Arrow keys: Control the direction of the snake.
- Enter: Start the game or restart after game over.

### Building and Running

To build and run the game:

1. Make sure you have the Raylib library installed on your system.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler with Raylib linked.
3. Run the compiled executable.

### Acknowledgments

Snake is based on the Raylib library, which provides the graphics and input handling functionalities. Special thanks to the Raylib development team for their work on this fantastic library.

Enjoy playing Snake!

Couldn't find snake textures that I liked so I used www.pixilart.com to manually draw it.
